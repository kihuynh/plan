# Post-Epicodus Plan


## Goals
May 11th, 2018

* __Take a breather (relax for a couple days, maybe plan a much needed trip)__
* __Work on refining portfolio pieces(3-5 pieces)__
  * Reformat and give proper styling
* Reach out to past internship to catch up & get guidance
* __Take care of my mental health, and general health (and thoroughly clean my room)__
  * Taking care of yourself is the most important, and shouldn't be neglected too long. Especially with the more important issues
* Add coding work to Squarespace portfolio
  * Adding to Squarespace because I had it prior to Epicodus
  * Pieces would be deployed on Heroku with links from my SS portfolio
* Practice general white boarding using coding wars
  * With other practice problems provided online
* Look into and start on AWS certifications
  * Either Architect or Developer route with Security speciality
* Go through Wes Bos lessons (Javascript 30)
* __Brush up on my design skills__
  * It's very rusty and reviewing/brushing up on it would be beneficial for me. Studied it in college, need to put it to good use.
* Clean up github by saving everything into one repository
  * Organized by sections learned during the program
* Watch Coding Train on youtube (1 video everyday or every other day)
* Research more on security. Starting with rails security
* Research on making an Alexa skill
  * Look into what languages and tutorials it takes to build a skill
  * Map out the purpose of my Alexa skill and outline it's functionality and purpose.
* Look through my HTML & CSS book by Jon Duckett
  * Brush up on styling
* __Look at job options in Australia & California__
  * Exploring some options to try to get myself out of Portland, maybe
  * See what other jobs are looking for in their requirements
* Research and play around with Amazon Lumberyard, and unity (purely for interest)
  * Currently have Unity but no opportunity to play around with it.
  * Lumberyard because it seems interesting
* Research on making mobile apps using RubyMotion (or other options)

## Summary of Goals

I tend to have interests all over the place with varying categories. But what is listed in bold is what I feel is what is relevant to me right now. Having interests web development, security, Alexa skills, mobile, and lumberyard/unity. I think it'll be good for me to explore more into these to be able to determine what I truly am interested and narrow those options down. Which makes my true goal in coding very difficult to determine right now. So my summary of my goals is probably not as detailed like my other classmates but I know I'll be able to pinpoint where I want to aim for. I'll get to my happy spot.
